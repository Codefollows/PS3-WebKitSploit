Flag is for Read/ReadWrite option + mask is applied.
I was told that there are 2 other possible flags but nobody seems to know what they do! It would need testing as well I suppose...

Well, there are two unused masks, maybe lv2 doesn't ignore them
0x0000000000020000ULL and 0x0000000000010000ULL
0x0000000000080000ULL is read-only, 0x0000000000040000ULL is read-write
and 0x00000000000F0000ULL is the mask



nt sys_mmapper_allocate_address(size_t size, uint64_t flags, size_t alignment, sys_addr_t * alloc_addr);
yes
it is
r3 = size
r4 = flag
